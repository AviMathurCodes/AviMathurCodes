# ♾️ Hi, I'm Avi Mathur!

🎓 Final-year B.Tech student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Shiv Nadar University**.  
🚀 Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and anything Space-related <3
📺 When I'm not coding, I'm playing cricket, badminton, reading murder mysteries or watching sci-fi movies

### 🔬 What I’ve Built
- 🧠 **Mini GPT (Transformer)** - Implemented a 2-layer transformer for text generation using PyTorch
- ⭐ **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** - Modern diffusion model from scratch trained on CIFAR-10
- 👁️ **YOLO-based Signature Detection** - Fine-tuned YOLO11n for object detection and achieved mAP50 ≈ 0.995  
- 😷 **Face Mask Detection & Recognition** - Combined segmentation + CNN classification for smart vision systems  
- ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** - Modeled PDEs through data-driven neural approximations
- 🧩 **Cache Simulator (C++)** - Multi-level cache system (set-associative) with LRU replacement and writeback
- 🚗 **Autonomous Line-Following Car** - Hardware-meets-AI with path planning via A* and PID tuning  

### 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` • `PyTorch` • `TensorFlow` • `Keras` • `OpenCV` • `C++` • `Scikit-learn` • `SQL`  

### 🌱 What I'm Exploring
- 🤖 Generative AI and transformer optimization  
- 📈 Transfer learning and interpretability in deep learning  
- 🛰️ Real-world applications of AI in imaging and communication systems
