# 👋 Hey there, I'm Avi Mathur!

🎓 Final-year B.Tech student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Communication** at **Shiv Nadar University**.  
💻 Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** — especially **transformer architectures** and **neural networks**.  
🚀 I love building intelligent systems that merge algorithms with creativity and real-world applications.

### 🔬 What I’ve Built
- 🧠 **Mini GPT (Transformer)** – Implemented a 2-layer transformer for text generation using PyTorch  
- 👁️ **YOLO-based Signature Detection** – Fine-tuned YOLO11n for object detection and achieved mAP50 ≈ 0.995  
- 😷 **Face Mask Detection & Recognition** – Combined segmentation + CNN classification for smart vision systems  
- ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** – Modeled PDEs through data-driven neural approximations
- 🧩 **Cache Simulator (C++)** – Multi-level cache system (direct-mapped, set-associative, fully associative) with LRU replacement; developed under **Prof. Venkatnarayan Hariharan** with **Achint Gupta**  
- 🚗 **Autonomous Line-Following Car** – Hardware-meets-AI with path planning via A* and PID tuning  

### 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` • `PyTorch` • `TensorFlow` • `Keras` • `OpenCV` • `C++` • `Scikit-learn` • `SQL`  

### 🌱 What I'm Exploring
- 🤖 Generative AI and transformer optimization  
- 📈 Transfer learning and interpretability in deep learning  
- 🛰️ Real-world applications of AI in imaging and communication systems
