# Hey there, I'm Avi Mathur!

🎓 Final-year B.Tech student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Shiv Nadar University**.  
💻 Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** - especially **transformer architectures** and **neural networks**.  
🚀 I love building intelligent systems that merge algorithms with creativity and real-world applications.

### 🔬 What I’ve Built
- 🧠 **Mini GPT (Transformer)** - Implemented a 2-layer transformer for text generation using PyTorch
- ⭐ **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** - Modern diffusion model from scratch trained on CIFAR-10
- 👁️ **YOLO-based Signature Detection** - Fine-tuned YOLO11n for object detection and achieved mAP50 ≈ 0.995  
- 😷 **Face Mask Detection & Recognition** - Combined segmentation + CNN classification for smart vision systems  
- ⚙️ **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** - Modeled PDEs through data-driven neural approximations
- 🧩 **Cache Simulator (C++)** - Multi-level cache system (set-associative) with LRU replacement; developed under **Prof. Venkatnarayan Hariharan**  
- 🚗 **Autonomous Line-Following Car** - Hardware-meets-AI with path planning via A* and PID tuning  

### 🧰 Tech Stack
