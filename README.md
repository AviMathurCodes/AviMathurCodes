# ♾️ Hi, I'm Avi Mathur!

- Final-year B.Tech student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Shiv Nadar University.  
- Passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and anything Space-related <3  
- When I'm not coding, I'm playing cricket, badminton, reading murder mysteries or watching sci-fi movies :)  

### 🔬 What I’ve Built
- **Mini GPT (Transformer)** - Implemented a 2-layer transformer for text generation using PyTorch
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** - Modern diffusion model from scratch trained on CIFAR-10
- **YOLO-based Signature Detection** - Fine-tuned YOLO11n for object detection and achieved mAP50 ≈ 0.995  
- **Face Mask Detection & Recognition** - Combined segmentation + CNN classification for smart vision systems  
- **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** - Modeled PDEs through data-driven neural approximations
- **Cache Simulator (C++)** - Multi-level cache system (set-associative) with LRU replacement and writeback
- **Autonomous Line-Following Car** - Arduino UNO controlled car with path planning via A* and PID tuning  

### 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` • `PyTorch` • `TensorFlow` • `Keras` • `OpenCV` • `C++` • `Scikit-learn` • `SQL`  

### 🚀 What I'm Exploring
- Generative AI and transformer optimization  
- Transfer learning and interpretability in deep learning  
- Real-world applications of AI in data science and imaging  

### ☕ Let's connect over a cup of kulhad chai & some momos on the side!
